18xx.games Bot - A friendly Discord chatbot
======================================================

On the back-end,
- this app starts at `server.py`
- add frameworks and packages in `requirements.txt`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`
- `.log.json` will be used to store the game schedule locally

[Discord features]
In the future this bot wants to learn how to: schedule future 
game sessions, send reminders, clean up channels, automatically 
convert time zones, and log finished game stats. 

[Other features]
In the future this bot also wants to learn how to: scrape the
18xx.games website to see whose turn it is, collect play data 
across all other public games for company winrates, performance 
per OR, etc. Making a webpage to display the bot's log might be
helpful. Also host privately on old PC.
